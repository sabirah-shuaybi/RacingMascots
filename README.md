# RacingMascots

This program contains three classes: RacingMohos, Mascots and Picture.

The RacingMohos Class handles all of the user mouse events and contains knowledge of the DrawingCanvas.
The class displays the racing lines as well as the visible images of the four mascots
at the start of the program. On a user's mouse click, this class starts the animation by invoking start().
